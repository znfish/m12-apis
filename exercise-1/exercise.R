### Exercise 1 ###

# Load the httr and jsonlite libraries for accessing data
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
## For these questions, look at the API documentation to identify the appropriate endpoint and information.
## Then send GET() request to fetch the data, then extract the answer to the question

# For what years does the API have statistical data?
response <- GET("http://data.unhcr.org/api/stats/time_series_years.json")
body <- content(response,"text")
years <- fromJSON(body)

# What is the "country code" for the "Syrian Arab Republic"?
response <- GET("http://data.unhcr.org/api/countries/list.json")
body <- content(response, "text")
country.codes <- fromJSON(body)
View(country.codes)
code <- country.codes %>% filter(name_en == "Syrian Arab Republic") %>% select(name_en, country_code)
# How many persons of concern from Syria applied for residence in the USA in 2013?
# Hint: you'll need to use a query parameter
# Use the `str()` function to print the data of interest
# See http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/who-we-help.html for details on these terms


## And this was only 2013...


# How many *refugees* from Syria settled the USA in all years in the data set (2000 through 2013)?
# Hint: check out the "time series" end points


# Use the `plot()` function to plot the year vs. the value.
# Add `type="o"` as a parameter to draw a line



# Pick one other country in the world (e.g., Turkey).
# How many *refugees* from Syria settled in that country in all years in the data set (2000 through 2013)?
# Is it more or less than the USA? (Hint: join the tables and add a new column!)
# Hint: To compare the values, you'll need to convert the data (which is a string) to a number; try using `as.numeric()`



## Bonus (not in solution):
# How many of the refugees in 2013 were children (between 0 and 4 years old)?


## Extra practice (but less interesting results)
# How many total people applied for asylum in the USA in 2013?
# - You'll need to filter out NA values; try using `is.na()`
# - To calculate a sum, you'll need to convert the data (which is a string) to a number; try using `as.numeric()`


## Also note that asylum seekers are not refugees
