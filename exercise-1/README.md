# Exercise-1
In this exercise, you'll practice reading the API of and requesting data from the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) API. To better understand the different possible endpoints, see <http://data.unhcr.org/wiki/index.php/API_Documentation.html>.

You can also find a set of interactive visualizations about this data (and more!) at <http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations>. For example, this page about the [Syrian Refugee Critis](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php).

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
