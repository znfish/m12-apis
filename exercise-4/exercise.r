# Install and load the jsonlite package
library(jsonlite)
library(httr)

# Make a variable base.url that has the same base url from the omdb documentation.
# (Hint: visit https://www.omdbapi.com/ to find the base url)


# Make a variable called movie that has the name of your favorite movie


# Make a variable called "query.parameters" that holds a list of the parameters
# to pass to the API. View the OMDb documentation to see which parameters
# are available.


# Make a variable called request that is a string of a request URL made up of the base URL
# and the parameters string


# Use fromJSON to retrieve JSON data from the omdb api using your request.
# Store the result in a variable called movie.data


# Make movie_data into a data frame using as.data.frame


# Write a function called Director that accepts a data frame of movie info and returns
# A vector of strings that states a movie and the director of said movie.


# Call Director with your favorite movie, and assign it to the variable movie.director



# Bonus #

# Knowing the director of on movie is okay, but it'd be great to know the directors of different
# movies. 

# Start by making a vecotr of movies and save it to the variable movie.list

# Write a function to make your API request and process the data

  # Make a variable called request that is a string of a request URL made up of the base URL
  # and the parameters string

# For every entry in the vector api.request, APPLY the function fromJSON to make a list of lists
# one entry for each request and assign this to a variable called data. 
# (Hint: ?lapply. It's similar a 'for' loop but better!)
